# MLIR Integration Status Report

## Overview

This report documents the current state of MLIR integration in the Tribute project as of December 2025, analyzing what has been completed, what remains, and evaluating whether to continue with MLIR or switch to an alternative like Cranelift.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Components

1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - `tribute-hir-dialect` crate created with melior 0.25.0
   - CMake integration for MLIR TableGen processing
   - TableGen dialect definition with 11 operations
   - Build system configuration (build.rs with CMake fallback)

2. **Type System**
   - `TributeValueType` for dynamic runtime values
   - MLIR type mappings for basic types (integer, float, string)
   - Type conversion utilities between HIR and MLIR

3. **Dialect Definition**
   - Complete TableGen definition (`TributeHIR.td`)
   - Operation builders for all 11 operations
   - Attribute definitions for constants
   - Test coverage (32 passing tests)

4. **Basic Framework**
   - Salsa integration queries defined
   - Error handling types (LoweringError, EvaluationError)
   - Module structure for HIR → MLIR lowering

### ❌ Critical Missing Components

1. **HIR → MLIR Lowering**
   - Current implementation only returns empty modules
   - Function definitions explicitly not supported ("Function definitions not yet supported")
   - Expression lowering methods exist but are unused
   - No actual code generation happens

2. **MLIR Execution**
   - `MLIREvaluator` contains only TODO comment: "TODO: Implement actual MLIR evaluation"
   - No MLIR ExecutionEngine or JIT compilation
   - No interpretation of MLIR operations
   - No connection to runtime value system

3. **Main Crate Integration**
   - `tribute-hir-dialect` is NOT a dependency of the main `tribute` crate
   - No MLIR execution paths in `trbi` or `trbc` binaries
   - No command-line flags for MLIR emission
   - HIR evaluator remains the only execution path

4. **MLIR Module Parsing**
   - Cannot parse MLIR text format to modules
   - `mlir_module_from_result` has TODO: "Implement MLIR text -> Module parsing"
   - No roundtrip capability for debugging

5. **Optimization Pipeline**
   - No MLIR pass manager integration
   - No optimization passes configured
   - No lowering to LLVM dialect
   - No native code generation

## Technical Analysis

### What We Have
- A well-structured foundation with proper abstractions
- Clean separation of concerns (HIR → MLIR → execution)
- Comprehensive type system design
- Good test infrastructure (though tests only verify structure, not execution)

### What's Actually Working
- Creating empty MLIR modules
- Building MLIR operations in isolation
- Type conversions between systems
- Basic infrastructure and build system

### Effort Required to Complete MLIR

1. **HIR → MLIR Lowering** (4-6 weeks)
   - Implement all expression lowering
   - Handle function definitions and calls
   - Control flow structures
   - Pattern matching support

2. **MLIR Execution** (3-4 weeks)
   - Set up ExecutionEngine
   - Implement runtime value marshaling
   - Connect to built-in functions
   - Handle dynamic typing at runtime

3. **Integration & Testing** (2-3 weeks)
   - Wire into main crate
   - Add CLI flags and options
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Performance benchmarking

**Total: 9-13 weeks of focused development**

## Cranelift Alternative Analysis

### Advantages
1. **Simpler Integration**
   - Pure Rust, no C++ FFI
   - No CMake or TableGen
   - Direct API usage
   - Proven in production (rustc, Wasmtime)

2. **Faster Development**
   - Could have basic compilation in 2-3 weeks
   - Simpler debugging
   - Better documentation
   - Active Rust community

3. **Better Fit for Dynamic Languages**
   - Designed for JIT compilation
   - Fast compilation times
   - Lower memory overhead
   - Used by dynamic language implementations

### Estimated Cranelift Timeline
1. **Basic Setup** (1 week)
   - Create tribute-cranelift crate
   - Set up module builder
   - Basic type mappings

2. **HIR → Cranelift IR** (2-3 weeks)
   - Expression compilation
   - Function compilation
   - Control flow
   - Runtime integration

3. **JIT Execution** (1-2 weeks)
   - Set up JIT compiler
   - Runtime value handling
   - Built-in function linking

**Total: 4-6 weeks to match current HIR evaluator performance**

## Recommendation

### Switch to Cranelift

The MLIR integration, while well-architected, is effectively at 20% completion with the hardest 80% remaining. The current code is mostly boilerplate that doesn't execute anything. Given that:

1. **No functional MLIR code exists** - Everything returns empty modules or TODOs
2. **Not integrated** - The dialect crate isn't even connected to the main project
3. **Significant effort remains** - 9-13 weeks vs 4-6 weeks for Cranelift
4. **Cranelift better suits Tribute's needs** - Dynamic language, JIT compilation, simpler integration

### Migration Strategy

1. **Preserve existing work**
   - Keep tribute-hir-dialect as reference implementation
   - Reuse type system design concepts
   - Apply learned architectural patterns

2. **Incremental approach**
   - Start with tribute-cranelift crate
   - Implement basic arithmetic first
   - Add features incrementally
   - Maintain HIR evaluator as fallback

3. **Future possibilities**
   - Can revisit MLIR later for specific optimizations
   - Cranelift and MLIR can coexist
   - MLIR might be better for static compilation later

## Conclusion

While the MLIR foundation is well-designed, the integration is far from complete and would require significant additional effort. Cranelift offers a more pragmatic path forward with faster results and simpler maintenance. The architectural work done for MLIR (HIR design, type system, evaluator pattern) will transfer directly to a Cranelift implementation.

The recommendation is to pause MLIR work and implement Cranelift-based compilation, which can deliver working native code compilation in half the time with fewer complexities.
