# Compiler Implementation Plan

**Status**: 🚧 **IN PROGRESS** - Cranelift-based implementation active  
**Prerequisites**: ✅ Modern Syntax (Plan 01), ✅ String Interpolation (Plan 01.01), ✅ Handle-based Runtime (completed), ❌ MLIR (abandoned)  
**Estimated Timeline**: 5 weeks (Cranelift approach)  
**Complexity**: Medium (simplified with Cranelift)

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of a native Tribute compiler. Originally planned with MLIR, the implementation has switched to **Cranelift** for faster development and better fit with Tribute's dynamic nature.

### Implementation Status

- **MLIR Approach**: Abandoned after analysis showed 80% work remaining with high complexity
- **Cranelift Approach**: ✅ **ACTIVE** - Infrastructure complete, core features in progress
- **Current Focus**: Completing Cranelift-based compiler (Plan 02.02)

### Strategic Goals

1. **Performance**: Native compilation for production workloads (3-5x faster than interpreter)
2. **Simplicity**: Use Cranelift for faster development and maintenance
3. **Runtime Integration**: Seamless integration with handle-based memory management
4. **Developer Experience**: Fast compilation times and clear error messages
5. **Production Ready**: Stable, reliable compiler for real-world use

### Implementation Approach

**Cranelift-Based Native Compilation**
- Use Cranelift IR for code generation from HIR
- Handle-based runtime integration for GC compatibility
- Dynamic typing with runtime type checking
- Focus on correctness first, optimizations later

**Why Cranelift**:
- Pure Rust implementation (no C++ dependencies)
- Proven in production (rustc, Wasmtime)
- Excellent for dynamic languages and JIT compilation
- Fast compilation times suitable for interactive development
- Simpler integration and debugging than MLIR

## Sub-Plans

1. **[Plan 02.01.01: MLIR Integration Status](02.01.01-mlir-integration-status.md)** - Analysis and decision to switch to Cranelift
2. **[Plan 02.02: Cranelift Completion](02.02-cranelift-completion.md)** - ✅ **ACTIVE** - Detailed implementation plan

## Current Focus: Cranelift Implementation

The active development effort is focused on **Plan 02.02** which provides a complete roadmap for finishing the Cranelift-based compiler. Key achievements and remaining work:

### ✅ Completed Infrastructure
- tribute-cranelift crate with full Cranelift integration
- Handle-based runtime API with DashMap optimization
- HIR → Cranelift IR basic translation pipeline
- Runtime function declarations for all operations

### 🚧 In Progress
- TrString enum-based 3-mode system (inline/static/heap)
- Complete HIR expression compilation
- String interpolation and pattern matching
- Linking pipeline for executable generation

## Architecture Overview

### Cranelift-Based Compilation Pipeline

**Current Implementation:**
```
AST (Tree-sitter) → HIR (Salsa) → Cranelift IR → Object File → Executable
```

**Key Components:**
- **tribute-ast**: Tree-sitter parsing to AST
- **tribute-hir**: HIR with Salsa incremental compilation
- **tribute-cranelift**: HIR to Cranelift IR compilation
- **tribute-runtime**: Handle-based runtime with DashMap optimization

### Benefits of the Cranelift Approach

1. **Pure Rust**: No C++ dependencies or complex build systems
2. **Fast Development**: Proven APIs and excellent documentation
3. **Production Ready**: Used by rustc and Wasmtime
4. **Dynamic Language Support**: Excellent for JIT and runtime type checking
5. **Simple Integration**: Direct FFI with runtime library

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Components
- **Runtime Library**: Full handle-based system with DashMap optimization
- **Cranelift Infrastructure**: ObjectModule, runtime function declarations
- **Basic Compilation**: Numbers, arithmetic, simple function calls
- **HIR Integration**: Salsa-based incremental compilation support

### Active Development
See **[Plan 02.02: Cranelift Completion](02.02-cranelift-completion.md)** for detailed implementation roadmap.

### Key Innovation: TrString Enum System
The planned TrString enum with three modes (Inline/Static/Heap) will provide:
- 100% heap allocation savings for short strings (≤23 bytes)
- Efficient compile-time string constant storage
- 30-40% overall memory reduction
- 5-10x performance improvement for string operations

## Summary

The Tribute compiler implementation has evolved from the original MLIR plan to a more pragmatic Cranelift-based approach. This change provides:

1. **Faster Development**: Pure Rust implementation with excellent tooling
2. **Better Fit**: Cranelift excels at dynamic language compilation
3. **Production Ready**: Proven technology used by rustc and Wasmtime
4. **Maintainable**: Simpler codebase without C++ dependencies
5. **Performance**: Target of 3-5x speedup over interpreter

The focus on TrString optimization and handle-based runtime integration creates a solid foundation for both performance and future garbage collection implementation.
