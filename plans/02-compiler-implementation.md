# Compiler Implementation Plan

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Cranelift-based native compiler operational  
**Prerequisites**: ✅ Modern Syntax (Plan 01), ✅ String Interpolation (Plan 01.01), ✅ Handle-based Runtime (completed), ❌ MLIR (abandoned)  
**Timeline**: Completed in 3 weeks (Cranelift approach)  
**Complexity**: Medium (simplified with Cranelift)

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of a native Tribute compiler. Originally planned with MLIR, the implementation has switched to **Cranelift** for faster development and better fit with Tribute's dynamic nature.

### Implementation Status

- **MLIR Approach**: Abandoned after analysis showed 80% work remaining with high complexity
- **Cranelift Approach**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Full end-to-end compiler operational
- **Achievement**: Working native compiler with linking pipeline and executable generation

### Strategic Goals

1. **Performance**: Native compilation for production workloads (3-5x faster than interpreter)
2. **Simplicity**: Use Cranelift for faster development and maintenance
3. **Runtime Integration**: Seamless integration with handle-based memory management
4. **Developer Experience**: Fast compilation times and clear error messages
5. **Production Ready**: Stable, reliable compiler for real-world use

### Implementation Approach

**Cranelift-Based Native Compilation**
- Use Cranelift IR for code generation from HIR
- Handle-based runtime integration for GC compatibility
- Dynamic typing with runtime type checking
- Focus on correctness first, optimizations later

**Why Cranelift**:
- Pure Rust implementation (no C++ dependencies)
- Proven in production (rustc, Wasmtime)
- Excellent for dynamic languages and JIT compilation
- Fast compilation times suitable for interactive development
- Simpler integration and debugging than MLIR

## Sub-Plans

1. **[Plan 02.01.01: MLIR Integration Status](02.01.01-mlir-integration-status.md)** - Analysis and decision to switch to Cranelift
2. **[Plan 02.02: Cranelift Completion](02.02-cranelift-completion.md)** - ✅ **ACTIVE** - Detailed implementation plan

## Completed Implementation: Cranelift Compiler

The Cranelift-based compiler has been successfully completed with full end-to-end functionality. See **Plan 02.02** for implementation details.

### ✅ Completed Core Features
- tribute-cranelift crate with full Cranelift integration

- Complete HIR → Cranelift IR translation pipeline
- Runtime function declarations for all operations
- **End-to-end linking pipeline for executable generation**
- **Cross-platform native compilation (macOS, Linux, Windows)**
- **Working native executables with runtime library integration**

### ✅ Advanced Features Completed  
- TrString enum-based 3-mode system (inline/static/heap) - 75% complete
- Pattern matching compilation with full control flow
- Arithmetic operations and function calls
- Basic string literal support
- StringConstantTable infrastructure for .rodata optimization

## Architecture Overview

### Cranelift-Based Compilation Pipeline

**Completed Pipeline:**
```
AST (Tree-sitter) → HIR (Salsa) → Cranelift IR → Object File → Native Executable
                                                              ↓
                                                    System Linker / rustc fallback
                                                              ↓
                                                    tribute-runtime library
```

**Key Components:**
- **tribute-ast**: Tree-sitter parsing to AST
- **tribute-hir**: HIR with Salsa incremental compilation
- **tribute-cranelift**: HIR to Cranelift IR compilation
- **tribute-runtime**: Handle-based runtime with DashMap optimization

### Benefits of the Cranelift Approach

1. **Pure Rust**: No C++ dependencies or complex build systems
2. **Fast Development**: Proven APIs and excellent documentation
3. **Production Ready**: Used by rustc and Wasmtime
4. **Dynamic Language Support**: Excellent for JIT and runtime type checking
5. **Simple Integration**: Direct FFI with runtime library
