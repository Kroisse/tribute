# Package Manager Plan

## Overview
Develop a modern package manager for Tribute with dependency resolution, version management, and seamless build integration.

## Priority: Medium (6/8)
Important for ecosystem growth but requires stable language foundation first.

## Core Features

### Package Definition
```tribute
// tribute.toml
[package]
name = "my-lib"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "A sample Tribute library"
authors = ["John Doe <john@example.com>"]

[dependencies]
std = "1.0"
json = "0.5"

[dev-dependencies]
test-utils = "0.2"
```

### Command Line Interface
```bash
# Package management
trb new my-project          # Create new project
trb add json@0.5           # Add dependency
trb remove json            # Remove dependency
trb update                 # Update dependencies

# Build and run
trb build                  # Build project
trb run                    # Run main binary
trb test                   # Run tests

# Publishing
trb publish               # Publish to registry
trb login                 # Authenticate with registry
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Local Package Management
1. Design package manifest format (tribute.toml)
2. Implement dependency resolution algorithm
3. Local package cache system
4. Basic build integration

### Phase 2: Registry Infrastructure
1. Central package registry design
2. Package publishing and authentication
3. Versioning and metadata management
4. Search and discovery features

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Lock file for reproducible builds
2. Workspace support for multi-package projects
3. Build scripts and custom tasks
4. Integration with CI/CD systems

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Tools
1. Package templates and scaffolding
2. Documentation generation integration
3. Benchmarking and profiling tools
4. Security vulnerability scanning

## Technical Design

### Dependency Resolution
- Semantic versioning (SemVer) support
- Conflict resolution with latest compatible versions
- Support for pre-release and build metadata
- Lockfile generation for reproducibility

### Package Storage
- Content-addressable storage for immutability
- Deduplication of common dependencies
- Efficient delta updates
- Offline mode support

### Build Integration
- Incremental compilation with cached artifacts
- Parallel dependency building
- Cross-compilation support
- Custom build scripts in Tribute

## Registry Architecture
```
Client (trb) ←→ Registry API ←→ Package Storage
                      ↓
                 Metadata DB
```

## Dependencies
- Standard library (for core utilities)
- Compiler (for building packages)
- Network library (for registry communication)
- Cryptography (for package verification)

## Success Criteria
- Fast and reliable dependency resolution
- Secure package distribution
- Seamless developer experience
- Active package ecosystem growth
